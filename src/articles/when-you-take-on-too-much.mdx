[Burnout: What Happens When You Take On Too Much](https://dev.to/mary_grace/burnout-what-happens-when-you-take-on-too-much-74d) is a great article by Mary Thengvall full of insights into both the causes and remedies of burnout. You may have heard about "boiling frog syndrome" and "death by a thousand cuts" before - these are both good analogies that describe what burnout is.

Mary has some advice for developers to combat burnout:

- schedule time off
- make a list of things that are your "oxygen"
- above all, put your oxygen mask on first

There is also helpful advice for managers looking to prevent burnout among their teams:

- schedule bi-monthly 1:1s
- encourage time off

She ends with a list of very useful resources.
